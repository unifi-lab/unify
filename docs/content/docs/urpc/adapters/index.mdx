## Overview

The `@unilab/urpc-adapters` package provides ready-to-use adapters for URPC, making it easy to get started with different data storage solutions. Whether you need temporary storage for development or persistent storage for production, we have you covered.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @unilab/urpc-adapters
```

## Available Adapters

### Memory Adapter
- **Use case**: Development, testing, temporary storage
- **Storage**: In-memory (lost on restart)
- **Speed**: Fastest access
- **Best for**: Development and caching

### Mock Adapter  
- **Use case**: Testing, prototyping
- **Storage**: In-memory (lost on restart)
- **Speed**: Fast
- **Best for**: Unit tests and demos

### IndexedDB Adapter
- **Use case**: Browser applications
- **Storage**: Persistent browser storage
- **Speed**: Good performance
- **Best for**: Client-side apps, PWAs, offline support

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { URPC } from "@unilab/urpc";
import { MemoryAdapter, MockAdapter, IndexedDBAdapter } from "@unilab/urpc-adapters";
import { UserEntity } from "./entities/user";

const MyPlugin = {
  entities: [UserEntity],
};

URPC.init({
  plugins: [MyPlugin],
  entityConfigs: {
    user: {
      defaultSource: "memory", // Choose your adapter
    },
  },
  globalAdapters: [MemoryAdapter, MockAdapter, IndexedDBAdapter],
});

// Use the repository
const user = await repo({
  entity: UserEntity,
}).create({
  data: {
    id: "1",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john@example.com",
  },
});
```

## Choosing the Right Adapter

| Adapter | Persistence | Environment | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Memory | No | Any | Development, caching |
| Mock | No | Any | Testing, prototyping |
| IndexedDB | Yes | Browser | Client apps, PWAs |
