   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Add new functionality to the appropriate package
   - Include comprehensive tests
   - Update documentation as needed

### Adding New Adapters

To add support for a new blockchain or data source:

1. **Create a new adapter class:**
   ```typescript
   import { BaseAdapter, FindManyArgs, FindOneArgs } from "@unilab/urpc-core";

   class YourAdapter extends BaseAdapter<YourEntity> {
     async findMany(args: FindManyArgs<YourEntity>): Promise<YourEntity[]> {
       // Implementation
     }
     
     async findOne(args: FindOneArgs<YourEntity>): Promise<YourEntity | null> {
       // Implementation
     }
     
     // ... other methods
   }
   ```

2. **Add proper TypeScript types:**
   ```typescript
   interface YourEntity {
     // Define your entity structure
   }
   ```

3. **Include comprehensive tests**
4. **Update documentation with usage examples**
