title: Local File Storage
description: Configure local file storage as your storage backend with @unify/server
---

## Overview

Local file storage is the default storage backend for @unify/server, designed primarily for local development and testing. It stores data directly on your local file system.

## Configuration

You can customize the local file storage behavior by explicitly configuring the storage options:

```typescript
import { createSource } from "@unify/server";
import { FileStorage } from "@unify/storage";

const source = createSource({
  options: {
    storage: new FileStorage("./data"),
  },
});
```

## Use Cases

Local file storage is ideal for:
- **Local development** - Quick setup without external dependencies
- **Testing** - Isolated test environments with predictable data storage
- **Prototyping** - Rapid development without cloud storage setup
- **Small applications** - Simple deployments where cloud storage isn't needed


## Notes

- The data directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist
- For production environments, consider using cloud storage adapters instead
- All data is stored as JSON files in the specified directory
